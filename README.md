# Dark Graph
![build](https://github.com/EcoBuilder13/dark-graph/workflows/Actions/badge.svg?event=push)

A Fabric and Quilt client mod that changes the debug frame graphs to use a dark theme.

## Compatibility
This mod should work with almost any other mod unless if it modifies the part of the code this mod interfaces. Compatibility has been tested with other mods such as [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) and [Better F3](https://modrinth.com/mod/betterf3). If you run into issues please report it on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/EcoBuilder13/dark-graph/issues).

## FAQ

- Can you port to Forge?

    - No, read the [notice](https://modrinth.com/mod/dashloader).
- Can you port to another version?

    - I will only port to newer versions of the game. All releases have their version limited to all minor releases of the current major version when released.
